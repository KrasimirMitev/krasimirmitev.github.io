# About me
------
I am a Master's student in the Medical Physics programme at [Sofia University 'St. Kliment Ohridski'](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng), [department of Physics](https://www.phys.uni-sofia.bg/). Currently, my work is focused on radiation measurements with organic scintillators and detectors development. Beside attending lectures, I am involved in two research projects at my university. Tinkering with available hardware, making 3D models and printing them are things that I like doing.
